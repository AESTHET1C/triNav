# triNav - iNav, but for tricopters!

triNav is a franken-fork of [iNav](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav) and [Triflight 0.5](https://github.com/lkaino/Triflight/releases/tag/0.5), a long-discontinued tricopter-specific fork of Cleanflight. This allows for proper tricopter manoeuvring using bespoke control algorithms.

Many thanks to [lkaino](https://github.com/lkaino) for driving Triflight's original development and [jihlein](https://github.com/jihlein) for their efforts merging Triflight into iNav and Betaflight years after its abandonment. This fork wouldn't have happened without them.

triNav is almost entirely untested, without support, and without promise of future releases. I do not have the free time to maintain it, nor the interest. I hope what I put forth is helpful, but expect radio silence.

If you're looking for an actual hex file, you're going to have to wait or compile things yourself. If you're familiar with Linux, just install Docker and run the build script.
